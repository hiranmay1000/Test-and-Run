there were some day when I was doing my best to provide best quality and values to the world and now see it has been changed there will be time where I may find myself in a situation where nobody is going to help me out. Apart from this I am going to achieve those things which I have alaways wanted. Today I should'nt sleep like that way if you really wanted to sleep then you should keep a timer to wake up after 20 mins. I overslept and I feel miserable I should listen to my heart to not to sleep today during day time but no I choose to sleep. It was a bad desicion, anyway I am going to get back to work again and forget about the past Nothing happens just have peitience Everything will be gonna be okay. I was having very bad times and now I am in such a phase. My body just couldn't even digest simple foods like soyabeens. It is having very bad day here. But I don't have to give up Just go on move on with every small failure. There were times where I used to be so charmed all the times and now see everything is becoming so shattered. Apart from these I like living here in Kolkata but my issue here is my food and diet is not okay.
